"KUYA, STOP DA JEEP!"

Early morning, sun is rising
Classes from seven 'til four awaiting
Yearning for the engine's roar
And rhythmic beeping galore

At last, a mobile capsule in sight
Relieving my mind from the "late" fright
Now, one of strangers huddled together
Sharing space in a metal racer

And there begins my journey
To a historic university
A symphony of urban sounds on the way
Even way before the bright sign of the day

Wheels turning, gears grinding
Through the chaos, steadily winding
A journey shared, yet unique
In this mobile capsule, so sleek

Stop after stop, the tale unfolds
Of stories written on city roads
Early morning hour, a fleeting grace
As we part ways, each to their own space

Kuya, stop da jeep!
Amidst the hustle, from me comes a peep
For in Philcoa I have arrived
Our journey has endedâ€”another jeepney to arrive
